FIGURE OUT AN ALGORITHM!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Figured out bitch
The Algorithm is created for half of the coditions
the algo rithm will be completed tomorrow


plan : {
		jan20{
			week1 : [[topic code1, status],[topic code2, status].....[topic coden, status]],
			week2 : [[topic code1, status],[topic code2, status].....[topic coden, status]],
			.
			.
			week4 : [[topic code1, status],[topic code2, status].....[topic coden, status]],
		},
		feb20{
			week1 : [[topic code1, status],[topic code2, status].....[topic coden, status]],
			week2 : [[topic code1, status],[topic code2, status].....[topic coden, status]],
			.
			.
			week4 : [[topic code1, status],[topic code2, status].....[topic coden, status]],
		}
	}

This is the current DATA Structure.
User will enter the target Year.
Basically, months will be calculated January of that year.
number of weeks = 4*no_of_months
then after getting number of months A disytribution array will be made according to the number of topics
sorting according to difficulty that will be sorted in the python itself
An account can be made in middle of themonth as well so give the week number accordingly

ALSO, check boxes of completion will only be shown to the topics of current month

All this will be done in handle_config
